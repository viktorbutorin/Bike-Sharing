# Kaggle Bike Sharing
This is a solution to Kaggle Bike Sharing competition aimed at predicting bike sharing demand in Washington D.C.

Hypotheses tested/steps taken: 

1) Filled n/a humidity and windspeed values
2) Hypothesis 1: number of rides varies by hour/month/season
3) Transforming hour/month/season from numeric values to sine/cosine
4) Hypothesis 2: number of rides varies on working and non-working days
5) Hypothesis 3: number of rides varies by day of the week.
6) Hypothesis 4: temperature affects number of rides
7) Hypothesis 5: humidity negatively affects number of rides
8) Hypothesis 6: windspeed affects number of rides
9) Hypothesis 7: weather affects number of rides
10) Modelling: Random Forest Regression with GridSearch CV
